The next increment is optional.
You don't have to do it.
If you decide to do it you can either:

1) Become a customer!
When a group/individual raises their hand you
are to visit them, and politely inform them
you have become a customer too!
See how much they have done, and suggest their
next very small increment.

or

2) Join a group!
When a group/individual raises their hand you
are to visit them, and if they are struggling,
stay with them and help them. Of course,
you must ask permission to join them, and
they may wish to work on without you, which
is fine. If you join a group you are not to
actually do them work for them. Your task is
to help them learn for themselves.
